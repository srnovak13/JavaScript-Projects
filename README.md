# JavaScript Projects
 These are some small JavaScript Projects I made for the Tech Academy
 
PIZZA MENU

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.
It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

Just a classic game of Tic Tac Toe! Players can choose their tokens, dice are 
randomly thrown to see who goes first. When someone wins, a congratulatory song is played. 

CALCULATOR

A basic 4-function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
